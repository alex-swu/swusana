# Swusana

Asana is great but some bits are annoying.  Doesn't support markdown.  There is a lot of noise on the detail page with stories telling you about who moved a task where and these sometimes obsuce the actual human comments.
If you run meetings and take notes into Asana you get added as a follower to every task.

This is a Tamper Monkey script to add buttons to the top nav bar of Asana that let you togle the following functionality: 
- Noise reduction: hide noise in the comments / non-coloured tags from list views.
- Markdown Support: add markdown support to Asana comments and code block syntax highighting.
- Auto-unfollow: A blackout period button that auto-unfollows you from all tasks while it is activated.

Currently only tested in Chrome.
